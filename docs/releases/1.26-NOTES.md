## Release notes for kOps 1.26 series

**&#9888; kOps 1.26 has not been released yet! &#9888;**

This is a document to gather the release notes prior to the release.

# Significant changes

* The default networking provider for new clusters is now Cilium.

* Control-plane instance groups in new clusters are now created with names starting
with "control-plane-". The names of groups for existing clusters are unchanged.

## AWS only

* Bastions are now fronted by a Network Load Balancer.

* Instance group images can now be dynamically fetched through an AWS SSM Parameter.

* The AWS Load Balancer, when enabled, will run on worker nodes if IRSA is enabled as of Kubernetes version 1.24.

* As of Kubernetes version 1.26 and with IRSA enabled, control plane nodes will now run with a max hop limit of 1 for the metadata service. This will prevent Pods without host networking from accessing the instance metadata service.

* IPv6 is now beta. New IPv6 clusters now default to using private topology.

* CapacityRebalance can be enabled/disabled on ASGs through a new `capacityRebalance` field in InstanceGroup specs.

* New clusters can more easily be configured to use Cilium in ENI mode by setting `--networking=cilium-eni`.
